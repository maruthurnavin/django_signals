### Usage

This code demonstrates how to use Django signals to automate tasks in your application. In this example, a welcome email is sent to new users upon registration. The key components are:
* The *send_welcome_email* signal in *django_signals/emails/signals.py*.
* The integration of the signal in the UserRegistrationView in *django_signals/users/views.py*.

You can adapt and extend this code to add other functionalities and signals as needed for your project.

## Benefits of Using Django Signals

 * Decoupling Code: Signals help decouple different parts of your application, making it more maintainable and extensible.
 * Flexibility: You can easily add or remove functionality without directly modifying core logic.
 * Reusability: Signals can be reused in various parts of your application, promoting modular and efficient code.
 * Scalability: Signals are particularly useful when your application needs to handle more events and custom behavior.
